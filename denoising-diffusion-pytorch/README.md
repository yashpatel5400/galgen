## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, in Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</a> in Pytorch. It is a new approach to generative modeling that may <a href="https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/">have the potential</a> to rival GANs. It uses denoising score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution, followed by Langevin sampling to sample from the true distribution.

This implementation was transcribed from the official Tensorflow version <a href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/denoising-diffusion-pytorch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install denoising_diffusion_pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8)
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,   # number of steps
    loss_type = 'l1'    # L1 or L2
)

training_images = torch.rand(8, 3, 128, 128) # images are normalized from 0 to 1
loss = diffusion(training_images)
loss.backward()
# after a lot of training

sampled_images = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_images.shape # (4, 3, 128, 128)
```

Or, if you simply want to pass in a folder name and the desired image dimensions, you can use the `Trainer` class to easily train a model.

```python
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion, Trainer

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8)
).cuda()

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,           # number of steps
    sampling_timesteps = 250,   # number of sampling timesteps (using ddim for faster inference [see citation for ddim paper])
    loss_type = 'l1'            # L1 or L2
).cuda()

trainer = Trainer(
    diffusion,
    'path/to/your/images',
    train_batch_size = 32,
    train_lr = 8e-5,
    train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
    ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
    amp = True                        # turn on mixed precision
)

trainer.train()
```

Samples and model checkpoints will be logged to `./results` periodically

## Multi-GPU Training

The `Trainer` class is now equipped with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>. You can easily do multi-gpu training in two steps using their `accelerate` CLI

At the project root directory, where the training script is, run

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```

## Miscellaneous

### 1D Sequence

By popular request, a 1D Unet + Gaussian Diffusion implementation. You will have to do the training code yourself

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet1D, GaussianDiffusion1D

model = Unet1D(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    channels = 32
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion1D(
    model,
    seq_length = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,
    objective = 'pred_v'
)

training_seq = torch.rand(8, 32, 128) # features are normalized from 0 to 1
loss = diffusion(training_seq)
loss.backward()

# after a lot of training

sampled_seq = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_seq.shape # (4, 32, 128)
```
